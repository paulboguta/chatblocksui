title: Introduction
description: chatblocks is a collection of AI-focused UI components built on top of shadcn/ui. Perfect for building chat applications, AI interfaces, and conversational experiences.
---

**This is not a traditional component library.** Instead, you copy the component code directly into your project and customize it to fit your needs.

## Why chatblocks?

Building AI chat interfaces requires specialized components that most UI libraries don't provide. chatblocks fills this gap with:

- **AI-Specific Components**: Input fields with AI features, chat bubbles, streaming indicators, token counters, and more
- **Built on shadcn/ui**: Extends the popular shadcn/ui system and patterns
- **Copy & Paste**: No package dependencies - you own the code
- **Customizable**: Modify any component to match your design system
- **Production Ready**: Components designed for real AI applications */}


## How it works

1. **Browse components** in our documentation
2. **Copy the code** using our CLI or copy/paste
3. **Customize** the components for your needs
