## Prerequisites

Before installing, ensure you have the following:

- **Node.js** version 18 or later
- **React** version 19 or later
- A **Next.js**, **Vite**, or **Remix** project

## Install shadcn/ui

**chatblocks** is built on top of shadcn/ui, so you'll need it as a foundation. If you haven't already, set up shadcn/ui by following their [installation guide](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation).

With shadcn/ui configured, you're ready to add **chatblocks** components to your project.

### Using the shadcn CLI

Install individual components using the shadcn CLI:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://chatblocks.dev/r/ai-input.json
```

You can also use other package managers:

```bash
# Using pnpm
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://chatblocks.dev/r/ai-input.json

# Using yarn
yarn dlx shadcn@latest add https://chatblocks.dev/r/ai-input.json

# Using bun
bunx shadcn@latest add https://chatblocks.dev/r/ai-input.json
```

### Usage

After installation, import and start using the components in your project:

```tsx
import { AiInput } from "@/components/ui/ai-input";

export default function MyPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <AiInput placeholder="Ask me anything..." />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Manual Installation

You can also manually copy and paste components from our documentation if you prefer not to use the CLI.
